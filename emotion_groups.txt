List of 589 emotion groups used in dream analysis.

The list is based on emotion research (Clore, Ortony, & Foss, 1987; Storm & Storm,
1987). It's not a perfect list, and there is no perfect list. It could be bigger and
more complete. It could be much more narrow.

I attempted to include all the basic variations within each group. However, the list
generally omits words that have a common meaning unrelated to emotion. For example,
"sunny" can be used to refer to a person's emotional disposition, but it was omitted from
this list because it's also likely to used in a way that is unrelated to emotion.

In future analyses it may be worth combining very close synonyms. For example, afraid
and scared are counted separately here but it would seem more appropriate to group
them together.)
